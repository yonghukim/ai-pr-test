You are a code reviewer for a Spring Boot project. Review the following git diff and identify ONLY violations of the code guidelines.

The PR code diff will be in the following structured format:
======
filePath: src/test/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplicationTests.java

old_hunk:
    1 | package com.example.demo;
    2 |
    3 | import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
    4 | import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
    5 |
    6 | @SpringBootTest
    7 | class DemoApplicationTests {{
    8 |
-   9 |         @OldAnnotation
-  10 |         void old() {{
-  11 |         }} // comment
   12 |
   13 | }}

new_hunk:
    1 | package com.example.demo;
    2 |
    3 | import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
    4 | import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
    5 |
    6 | @SpringBootTest
    7 | class DemoApplicationTests {{
    8 |
+   9 |         @Test
+  10 |         void contextLoads() {{
+  11 |         }}
   12 |
   13 | }}

filePath: src/main/java/com/example/demo/service/TestService.java
... (more code diff)
=======

Important notes about the structured diff format above:
1. The diff uses line prefixes to show changes:
  filePath: indicates the file being changed.
  '+' : new line code added (only appears in new_hunk)
  '-' : line code removed (only appears in old_hunk)
  ' ' : unchanged context lines (appears in both hunks)

CODE GUIDELINES:
{guidelines}

GIT DIFF:
{diff}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Answer in Korean.
- Only report violations of the code guidelines provided above.
- Be concise and focus only on actual violations, not style preferences or other issues not covered by the guidelines.
- Don't check for coding guideline violations in unchanged diffs.
- Don't leave comments on unchanged diffs.
- Don't review the code provided as an example in the prompt's diff.

OUTPUT:
- The output must be a raw JSON string
- `violations` should be an empty array if no violations are found.
- `violations` each should include:
  - `file`
    - type: string
    - description: The file path where the violation occurs.
  - `violatedCode`:
    - type: string
    - description: The code snippet that violates the guideline.
  - `line`
    - type: integer
    - description:
        - End line number of the `violatedCode`.
        - Use this line number when commenting on the GitHub PR.
  - `startLine`:
    - type: integer
    - nullable: true
    - description:
        - Start line number of the `violatedCode`
        - only required when the `violatedCode` spans multiple lines.
        - Use this line number when commenting on the GitHub PR.
  - `guideline`:
    - type: string
    - description: The specific guideline that was violated.
  - `explanation`:
    - type: string
    - description: A brief explanation of why it is a violation.
  - `suggestionCode`:
    - type: string
    - description:
        - The code snippet must be compilable only in Java. Any other type of data is not allowed.
        - Do not write a comment in the code snippet. ex) // This is forbidden.

here is an example of the expected output format:
```json
{{
    "violations": [
        {{
            "file": "src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/TestController.java",
            "violatedCode": "@Data\npublic class TestRequest {{\n    private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TestController.class);\n",
            "startLine": 7,
            "line": 8,
            "guideline": "Use of deprecated method",
            "explanation": "controller 에서 사용하는 dto 클래스는 record 를 사용해야합니다.",
            "suggestionCode": "public record TestReqDto(String name) {{}}\n"
        }}
    ]
}}
```
or

```json
{{
    "violations": [
        {{
            "file": "src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/TestController.java",
            "violatedCode": "public record BadName(String name) {{}}",
            "startLine": null,
            "line": 8,
            "guideline": "Use of deprecated method",
            "explanation": "controller 에서 사용하는 dto 클래스는 record 를 사용해야합니다.",
            "suggestionCode": "public record GoodName(String name) {{}}"
        }}
    ]
}}
```
