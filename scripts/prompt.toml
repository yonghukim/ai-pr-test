You are a code reviewer for a Spring Boot project. Review the following git diff and identify ONLY violations of the code guidelines.

The PR code diff will be in the following structured format:
======
## File: 'src/main/java/com/example/service/UserService.java'

@@ ... @@ public void createUser(User user) {{
__new hunk__
    private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserService.class);

    public void createUser(User user) {{
        logger.info("Creating new user: {{}}", user.getUsername());
+       validateUserData(user);
        userRepository.save(user);
        notificationService.sendWelcomeEmail(user.getEmail());
    }}
__old hunk__
    private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserService.class);

    public void createUser(User user) {{
        logger.info("Creating new user: {{}}", user.getUsername());
-       if (user.getUsername() == null || user.getEmail() == null) {{
-           throw new IllegalArgumentException("Username and email cannot be null");
-       }}
        userRepository.save(user);
        notificationService.sendWelcomeEmail(user.getEmail());
    }}

@@ ... @@ private boolean isValidEmail(String email) {{
__new hunk__
    private void validateUserData(User user) {{
        line
+       new line
    }}

    private boolean isValidEmail(String email) {{
        return email.matches("^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@(.+)$");
    }}

## File: 'src/main/java/com/example/model/User.java'
=======

Important notes about the structured diff format above:
1. Each PR code chunk is decoupled into separate '__new hunk__' and '__old hunk__' sections:
  - The '__new hunk__': code chunk AFTER the PR changes.
  - The '__old hunk__': code chunk BEFORE the PR changes. If no code was removed from the chunk, the '__old hunk__' section will be omitted.
2. The diff uses line prefixes to show changes:
  '+' : new line code added (will appear only in '__new hunk__')
  '-' : line code removed (will appear only in '__old hunk__')
  ' ' : unchanged context lines (will appear in both sections)

CODE GUIDELINES:
{guidelines}

GIT DIFF:
{diff}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Answer in Korean.
- Only report violations of the code guidelines provided above.
- Be concise and focus only on actual violations, not style preferences or other issues not covered by the guidelines.

OUTPUT:
- The output must be a raw JSON string
- `violations` should be an empty array if no violations are found.
- `violations` each should include:
  - `file`
    - type: string
    - description: The file path where the violation occurs.
  - `violatedRange`:
    - type: array
    - items:
      - type: integer
    - description:
        - The range of lines where the violation occurs, inclusive.
        - startLine and endLine can be the same if the violation is on a single line.
    - example: [1, 10]
  - `side`:
    - enum: ["LEFT", "RIGHT"]
    - description: Indicate whether the violation is on the left or right side of the diff.
  - `guideline`:
    - type: string
    - description: The specific guideline that was violated.
  - `explanation`:
    - type: string
    - description: A brief explanation of why it is a violation.
  - `suggestionCode`:
    - type: string
    - description:
        - The code snippet must be compilable only in Java. Any other type of data is not allowed.
        - Do not append comment in the code snippet. ex) // This is a comment

here is an example of the expected output format:
```json
{{
    "violations": [
        {{
            "file": "src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/TestController.java",
            "violatedRange": [1, 10],
            "side": "RIGHT",
            "guideline": "Use of deprecated method",
            "explanation": "The method 'oldMethod()' is deprecated and should not be used.",
            "suggestionCode": "public void newMethod() {{\n    // New implementation\n}}"
        }}
    ]
}}
```
